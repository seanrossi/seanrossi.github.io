  <p><i><b>This game is currently in development and does not represent the final product.</b></i></p>
  <p>Good Bad Woof is a 2D side-scrolling platform game that is being solely developed by me. This includes the graphics, the music, the sound effects and especially the programming. I wanted to make a complete game without the need for quality assets to slow progress, so I took it upon myself to create everything the game uses.</p>
